# Speller

This program takes a two files as input, a file labeled as a dictionary that has a dictionary of words that are misspelled
there is also a file corresponding to that dictionary that has a series of text that the program must compare the text to the dictionary words.

dictionary.c takes the dictionary file as input and stores each word in a linked list.

The only file that I wrote in this project was dictionary.c as the purpose of the project was to learn about linked lists, how to create and navigate them.

all of the other files are provided by Cs50.
